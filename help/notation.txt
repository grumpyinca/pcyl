 The basic command syntax consists of a command verb followed by a number of
 modifiers separated by spaces.  A "modifier" is any word that follows the
 command on the command line.  It is always separated from other modifiers
 by one or more spaces.

 An optional modifier is noted by enclosing the modifiers in angle < >
 brackets.  If modifiers are omitted from the command line, the program will
 prompt for them.  A complex command might be described as:

 COMMAND  < modifier_class_1 modifier_class_2 >  < ABC XYZ >  < etc >

 This notation contains the following elements:

    Commands and modifiers that are to be keyed in explicitly are shown in
    upper case.

    A class of modifiers is described in lower case.  The user is expected
    to select and key in a specific element of the class as the modifier.

    Underscores are used to attach multiple words so the command interpreter
    will treat them as a single modifier.

 In the example given above, the user is expected to key in up to 4
 elements:  The command, a modifier selected from either "modifier_class_1"
 or "modifier_class_2", either the modifier ABC or XYZ and a modifier
 selected from the class "etc".

 Other examples:
 SEEK     < MAXIMUM MINIMUM >  < variable_name >
 START    < file_name >  < YES NO >
 SELECT   < parameter_name  CATALOG >  < catalog_name >
 LIST     variable_name
