 This section introduces "functionally determined constraint levels".

 When a constraint level is determined as the value of an independent or
 dependent variable (as opposed to being a simple constant), the word
 "FUNCTION" appears in the status column.  The status column might otherwise
 designate that variable as "FIXED".

 The  LIST LEVELS  command provides a summary of all functionally determined
 constraint levels.

 Functionally determined constraint levels may be established with the
 CHANGE command and eliminated with the FREE command.

 For example:
    CHANGE  FORCE_1  MIN  INITIAL_TENSION

 This example establishes a lower constraint on FORCE_1 that is the value of
 INITIAL_TENSION.  If the value of initial tension decreases during a
 search, the value of FORCE_1 will be permitted to adjust correspondingly.
 If the value of INITIAL_TENSION increases, the value of FORCE_1 may be
 forced to increase a similar amount.

    CHANGE  STRESS_INITIAL  MAX  STRESS_INIT_HI

 This example establishes an upper constraint on STRESS_INITIAL that is the
 current value of STRESS_INIT_HI.  When combined with a similar lower
 constraint, this works to keep the stress caused by initial tension in an
 extension spring within a range that is acceptable.  STRESS_INIT_HI is
 calculated as a function of spring index and will change continuously
 during a search.

 The command:
    FREE  STRESS_INITIAL

 will remove all constraints (functionally determined or otherwise) from the
 variable STRESS_INITIAL.
