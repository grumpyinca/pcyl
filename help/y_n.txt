 The program will occasionally ask the user for a YES-NO response with a
 prompt of the form:

    DO YOU WISH TO .... ?  (y/N) :

 The "(y/N)" part of the prompt indicates that the user is expected to reply
 with "y" for yes or "n" for no.  The capitalized letter indicates the
 default that the program will assume if it does not understand the user's
 input.  For example, in the case shown here, if the user enters a null line
 (carriage return without any preceding input) in response to the question,
 the program will take the same action as if the user had entered "n".

 This program is structured this way to permit a null line to be used to
 accept the most frequently used option.  It reduces the need for typing and
 allows the program to suggest a response to guide novice users.
