 LIST  < modifier >

 LIST produces a console listing of various quantities of interest.
 Modifiers accepted by the LIST command are:

 ALL        -  all information available
 DESIGN     -  values of independent variables only
 DEPENDENT  -  values   of dependent variables & constraint levels
 CONSTANTS  -  values of constants only
 FIXED      -  current status of variables
 INDEPENDENT-  values of independent variables & constraint levels
 INTERNAL   -  values of internal variables
 LABEL      -    data labeling a design with user specific information
 LEVELS     -  status of functionally determined constraints
 OBJECTIVE  -  value of objective function only
 SATISFIED  -  magnitude of all constraint violations
 VIOLATIONS -  magnitude of only   the violated constraints
 STATE      -  values of dependent variables only

 The value of any variable or constraint level may be obtained by using its
 name as a modifier in the LIST command.

 LIST will accept multiple modifiers on the comman  d line.  They will be
 processed in order from left to right.

 Synonyms for the LIST modifiers are:

 PARAMETERS -  values of independent variables only
 VARIABLES  -  values of dependent   variables only
 BOTH       -  values of independent & de  pendent variables
 DP     -  values of independent variables only
 SV     -  values of dependent   variables  only

 examples:

   LIST  VIOL
                (produces listing of constraint violations)

   LIST  STR
                (produces listing of all names be  ginning
                 the characters STR)

   LIST  LABEL
                (produces listing of user specific
                 stored with the SET LABEL command)

   LIST  ID  OD  FS
                (produces listing of all names beginning
                 with the characters ID, OD, or FS)

 Not  e:    A single call is made to the default equation set whenever the
 LIST command is used.  This guarantees that the values printed will be
 current.

 The IOOPT and CLASS internal variables control the printing of the
 variables during output.  When I  OOPT is less than CLASS for a given
 variable, that variable is not listed by the LIST command.  The IOOPT and
 CLASS internal variables are controlled by the SET command.  All variables
 appear in the listings created by the SAVE and LIST ALL command  s regardless
 of the values of IOOPT and CLASS.
